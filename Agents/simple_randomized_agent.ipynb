    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square is cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",

    "## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n",

    "__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To starte, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actuators:__ The agent can `clean` the current square or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n",

    "I think it is fair to say that the model-based agent in this N x N square room scenario was the better performer considering the two main performance measures (cleaning and energy units used). I think (at least visually), the graphs clearly tell that story as well. If we pay attention to just the cleaning performance, we can easily tell that the reflex agent performs better than the randomized agent, and the model-based agent performs better than either of the two. We can see that the randomized and reflex agents both suffer as the N increases, while the model-based agent is able to fully clean the room under the same circumstances.\n",

    "The Energy usage also shows that the Model-based agent was the best of the three as well. Notice that for the max-steps, I gave the formula: \n",

    "\n",
    "Where $N$ is the size of the $N {\\times} N$ Room\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this was to give the agents enough moves, even if it started at an un-optimal position, and enough to go around and suck the dirt. I will admit that this was a little biased towards the un-optimal position of the Model-based agent, however, it should have been more than enough in all scenarios for every agent, and yet two of the agents were still unable to succeed in cleaning the rooms in most cases. The Model-based agent was the only agent that was able to use the energy somewhat-resourcefully ( though only in this easy example), since it did not always start at an un-optimal position. Perhaps a future implementation can make the agent more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the reason for this landslide victory for the model-based agent is that the model-based agent does not act completely on randomness. The Reflex agent and Randomized agent, though only one carries the name 'randomized', are both essentially randomized; the only difference being that the reflex agent responds to its percepts in a limited fashion. The Model-based agent has structure in its movements and executes identically in every scenario. This is great for this N x N example, but it would be completely destroyed  if any other little difference were to be added."

    "I think as it stands, my model-based implementation would be okay in a rectangular room. One possible issue is that the logic for being aware of its locaion needs to know the size of the room, and if we throw in variable x,y dimensions, as it stands, it would be unable to do this accurately. In fact I believe there would probably be some out of bound errors since the agent assumes it is in a square room. Once we expand past a square grid, the agent will go out of bounds. However, the agent would still be able to clean most or a lot of the squares in the room. The reason for this is that, as I have implemented it, it will still be able to find a corner and keep going up and down across the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same goes for irregular shapes: there would need to be additional logic to handle differences in dimensions, or I would need to refactor the entire logic to be able to work in any type of shape. The agent as it stands would still try to find a corner and navigate up and down across the room. However, because of the irregular shape, the agent would assume it has hit a north/south wall in a square room, rather than an irregular-shaped room\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, obstacles would also throw off my poor little agent. As it stands an obstacle would confuse it into thinking it has reached a wall, and it would go to the next column to clean. This would mean it would be unable to clean all squares past that obstacle, and it would be confused into thinking it was in a smaller sized square.\n",

    "As for the other agents, they would perform just the same, regardless of the environment. In fact they may perform better than the model-based agent because they would continue to move randomly, and their performance in square rooms would be just about the same in rectangle rooms, irregular rooms, and rooms with obstacles. The Model-based agent logic would be thrown out the door, while the logic for these two agents would continue to perform exactly the same in any given scenario."

Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 10000 time steps. This is very tricky!"
